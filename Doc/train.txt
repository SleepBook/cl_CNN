You mainly interact with the train part through 3 scripts:
	trainLenet.m  which will train the net using MNIST dataset and do a correct rate sampling
	NetExtractor.m which will extract the net configure into a file under the output dirtory
	DataExtractor.m which will extract single/multi frames from the MNIST dataset as a file, also under output directory

The APIs composing these scripts(which are defined under Functions directory)

	loadMNISTImages/loadMNISTLabels: automatically extrace the binary files from the MNIST database

	initialNet: initialize the link values

	cnnff: feed-forward calculation

	cnnbp: back-propragation

	applyGrads: use the gradient to adjust the link weights

The parameter for training can be changed inside the train.m script. if you want to change the iteration for training, change the lines betwenn 27-31. alpha represent the learning rate, batchsize is the number of samples in a single calculation, and numberpochs is total training iterations(current set at 20)
